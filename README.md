# simple-neural-network-for-solving-4x4-tic-tac-toe
This project was made to fulfill the task of solving 4x4 tic-tac-toe using the neural network, for Tomsk State University.

ACCURACY ~96%
The network solves only 4x4 fields, where the crosses are a step away from victory. The answer will be x,y coordinate of
point, where You need to put the cross to win.
|-------------------|
| Designations:     |
| X - cross         |
| O - zero          |
| . - empty field   |
|-------------------|
The program reads files from the file "input.txt" and saves the result to "output.txt". MANDATORY these files must be in the same folder as the application.
If You want to change study data, just edit "data.txt".
